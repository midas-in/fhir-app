The Immunization module is built in accordance with WHO immunization guidelines and can be adapted to local country contexts. The app has the ability to show a list of children, per village / location that are due specific types of vaccines on a specific day. It therefore helps with outreach planning around community vaccination days. It also helps with reporting and follow-up for children that did not attend a scheduled vaccination event. Features like colour-coding \u2013 making it easier to see which children are due or overdue \u2013 and the ability to quickly register multiple vaccines that are administered on the same day, contributes to good user experience and easy navigation. The first local adaptation of the immunization module was conducted in Zambia. Mauritania, Malawi, Togo, Guinea, Liberia.
